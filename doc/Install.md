# Get BaudEngine release version

* first you can need download application for baudengine

````
wget http://xxxxxx

> you can run it , to get config param

````$xslt
./baudengine -f

  -conf string
    	baud config path (default "/Users/sunjian/go/src/github.com/tiglabs/baudengine/config/config.toml")
  -master string
    	baud config for master name , is on local start two master must use it
````  
* -conf is your config file path 
* -master is your master name, in this example like `m1`,`m2` . Usually you don't have to set itï¼Œit found master name by your local IP ,  but when you one machine startd two master you must tell it the master name like `-master m1`
